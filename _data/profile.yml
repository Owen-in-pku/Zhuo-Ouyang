  <p>
    I am a fourth year undergraduate student at College of Engineering, <a href="https://english.pku.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Peking University</a>, where I am fortunate to be advised by
    <a href="https://yisenwang.github.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Yisen Wang </a> in <strong>self-supervised learning</strong> and Prof. 
    <a href="https://pengcheng-you.github.io/desires-lab/" target="_blank">Pengcheng You</a> in <strong>reinforcement Learning</strong>. 
    I expect to receive my bachelor's degree in Robotics Engineering in June 2026.
    I am currently a visiting student at Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), Johns Hopkins University, advised by Prof. <a href="https://mallada.ece.jhu.edu/" target="_blank">Enrique Mallada</a> 
    in <strong>data-driven learning in nonlinear systems</strong>.
  <p>
    My research interest covers <strong>self-supervised learning</strong>, <strong>reinforcement learning</strong>, and <strong>data driven learning method in Hamiltonian systems</strong>.
    I am currently interested in generalizing <strong>transfer learning paradigm</strong> to safe reinforcement learning settings, utilizing 
    offline dataset from source environment to enhance sample efficiency in target environment.
