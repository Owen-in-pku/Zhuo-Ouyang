  <p>
    I am a fourth year undergraduate student at the College of Engineering,
    <a href="https://english.pku.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Peking University</a>.
    I expect to receive my bachelor's degree in Robotics Engineering in June 2026.
    <strong>My GPA is 3.86/4.0, ranking 1st/26 in the Robotics major and top 5% (156 students) in the College of Engineering.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    I am very fortunate to be advised by
    <a href="https://yisenwang.github.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Yisen Wang</a> in self-supervised learning, and
    <a href="https://pengcheng-you.github.io/desires-lab/" target="_blank">Prof. Pengcheng You</a> in reinforcement learning.
    And I am currently a visiting research student at <a href="https://engineering.jhu.edu/ece/" target="_blank">Electrical and Computer Engineering</a>, Johns Hopkins University,
    advised by Prof. <a href="https://mallada.ece.jhu.edu/" target="_blank">Enrique Mallada</a> in data-driven learning and control in nonlinear systems (especially in Hamiltonian systems).
  </p>

  <p>
    My research interest covers <strong>self-supervised learning</strong>, <strong>reinforcement learning</strong>, and <strong>data-driven learning methods in Hamiltonian systems</strong>.
    I am currently interested in generalizing <strong>transfer learning paradigm</strong> to safe reinforcement learning settings, utilizing offline dataset from source environment to enhance sample efficiency in target environment.
    <strong><u>I am actively applying for a PhD position for Fall 2026!<u/></strong>
